## I. Installation and Running
1. First, download `release.7z` or `release.zip` from the release page.

2. Then extract it using Windows' built-in extraction option or a third-party extraction tool (we recommend using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)) in File Explorer.

3. Next, locate `macdowsOS Tool UI.exe` in the extracted folder, right-click it, and select **"Run as administrator"**.


## II. Usage
### Precautions
1. Please <span style="color:#e60000;">make sure</span> to run as administrator. Although macdowsOS Tool does not check the current running permissions and can still run without administrator privileges, when macdowsOS Tool modifies some system files, it <span style="color:#e60000;">may</span> cause system file corruption due to insufficient permissions.

2. macdowsOS Tool uses automatic operation technology for installing some components, which may be detected as a virus by some antivirus software. It is recommended to exit or disable all antivirus software before installation.

3. The author does not guarantee that macdowsOS Tool will not cause any system problems. However, the restore point component of macdowsOS Tool has been disabled due to serious bugs. <span style="color:#e60000;">It is strongly recommended</span> to set a system restore point and back up system files before installation.

#### Possible issues with this feature
**Q. What should I do if an error pop-up appears?**  
A. Please provide the error pop-up, and I will respond.

**Q. What should I do if the installation gets stuck?**  
A. Please enable debug mode in the settings, then when the installation gets stuck, end macdowsOS Tool using Task Manager and send `log.txt` to me.

**Q. What should I do if macdowsOS Tool becomes unresponsive during installation?**  
A. macdowsOS Tool is not unresponsive; only the window is unresponsive. Since macdowsOS Tool performs operations in a single thread, it cannot continue running the window loop while executing the installation, so the window may appear unresponsive. This is completely normal.


### System Repair Feature
macdowsOS Tool uses command lines to perform system repairs. The commands are from [Huawei](https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/support/content/zh-cn15906534/).


### Window Rounded Corners Feature
The current window rounded corners feature uses Windows API to create rounded corner regions to clip the window, so the compatibility is not very good. This will be optimized later.

The usage guide is written in the configuration file, so it will not be covered here.


#### Possible issues here
**Q. What should I do if the changes do not take effect?**  
A. Please return to the main interface of macdowsOS Tool to make changes.
